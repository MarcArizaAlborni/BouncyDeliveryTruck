About the game:

This game is a 3D game in which you are a truck driver and have to move the maximum amount of Packages to the Finish Line.
Through the level you will find several obstacles that will try to make some of the packages fall of the truck.

There are 4 parts each with a different challenges Part1(Zig-Zag) Part2(Obstacles) Part3(Moving Obstacles) Part 4 (Destructible Walls) Part5(Bridge)




## INNOVATION

-Modified Vehicle, Suspension Modified to make it bounce and give some challenge to the game.
-Checkpoint
-Restart from Start or Checkpoint
-Detects amount of packs when the player reaches checkpoint
-Different types of obstacles each requiring something different to the player
-Hinge Constraint Obstacles
-Detects amount of packs when the player reaches the Finish Line and has different rewards depending on the amount
-Adaptable camera that will chase the vehicle, but will rotate around it when turning to make it easier for the player.
-Boost area where the vehicle will accelerate at a much faster rate


##TROUBLE
-Loading the level for the first time may lag a bit for( 1/2 seconds)
-When restarting the packages don't reset speed so various restarts may be necessary until they stay still
-If the car starts to shake hard, restart the game
-It is perfectly possible to get all 3 packages to the finish line, you just have to practice abit.
